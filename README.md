# Road Builder [BETA]

A Project Zomboid mod that adds a Dump Truck capable of laying gravel roads.

## Features

- Custom Volvo FE6 Dump Truck model (courtesy of fhqwhgads from Motorius Zone!)
- Configurable road width: 2 or 3 tiles wide via radial menu
- Automatic edge blending: gravel roads blend smoothly with grass and terrain
- Smart corner filling: gaps between angled roads automatically fill in
- Press (G) or use the vehicle radial menu to start/stop dumping gravel
- Realistic spawn variation: 50% chance trucks spawn with 80-100% gravel load
- Spawns in appropriate zones (construction sites, farms, industrial areas, etc.)

1. Subscribe to the mod on the Steam Workshop
2. Enable the mod in your game's mod list
3. Start a new game or load an existing save
