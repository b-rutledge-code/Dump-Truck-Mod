title=Road Builder [BETA]
description=[Beta] This mod will eventually require Filibuster Rhyme's Used Cars! when it is oficially released for B42.  He has a great Dump Tuck model.  Until then its just using the vanilla pickup truck script so I can go ahead and release it and get feedback. Road Builder is a work in progress until the stable branch is released.
