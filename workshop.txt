description=Road Builder adds a Dump Truck to Project Zomboid capable of laying a two-tile-wide gravel road to B42. Use the vehicle menu or press (G) to start dumping gravel.

description=To load a Dump Truck place sacks of gravel in the bed of the truck. 50% of Dump Trucks will spawn with a full load and a shovel, the other half spawn with an empty bed. The spawn locations are the same as vanilla pickup trucks.

description=[i][Beta Notes] I'm in search of an actual dump truck model to use for this mod. If anyone knows a modeler who would be interested in creating a dump truck specifically for this mod I'd love to hear from them! Until then its using a copy of the vanilla pickup truck script so I can go ahead and release it and get feedback. The mod itself is not vanilla and will be compatible with mods that disable vanilla vehicles.
