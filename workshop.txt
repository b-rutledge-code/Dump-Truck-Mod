description=[i][Beta Notes] This mod will eventually require Filibuster Rhyme's Used Cars! when it is officially released for B42 through the workshop.  He has a great Dump Tuck model.  Until then its using a copy of the vanilla pickup truck script so I can go ahead and release it and get feedback. If anyone knows a modeler who would be interested in creating a dump truck specifically for this mod I'd love to hear from them!
