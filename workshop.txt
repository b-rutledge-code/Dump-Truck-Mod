description=[h2]Usage[/h2]

description=2. Load gravel sacks into the truck bed (if empty or low)
description=3. Press (G) or use the vehicle radial menu to start dumping gravel
description=4. (Optional) Toggle road width between 2 and 3 tiles via radial menu

description=[Note] As of the 42.13 update trunk capacity seems to be pegged at 100.  Since this impacts the vanilla vehicles as well (ie Frankline Valuline & Dash Bulldriver, etc) it seems like a bug that Indie Stone will need to patch.
